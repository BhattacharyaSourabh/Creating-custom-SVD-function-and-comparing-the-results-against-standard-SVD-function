# Creating-custom-SVD-function-and-comparing-the-results-against-standard-SVD-function
The aim of the project was to create a custom Support Vector Decomposition(SVD) function and compare the results against its standard counterpart. To calculate the singular vectors generated against the eigen values Power Iteration method was used. The results were compared as well the graph of convergence was also plotted to give a clear understanding of the entire process.
